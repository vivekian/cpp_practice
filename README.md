The idea behind this repository is to solve Scott Meyers examples illustrated in his 3 famous books: 

    - Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs (3rd Edition)
    - More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs 
    - Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14

This is primarily for my practice, but I hope someone else can benefit from it as well. 

This code is compiled and tested on MacOSX using clang++. 
Most programs are standalone single files since they are just examples, and are compiled using this command line: 

    clang++ -std=c++11 <input_file>
