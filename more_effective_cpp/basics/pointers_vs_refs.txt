- references always have to be initialized. 
- no 'null' references as compared to pointers so no null checking. 
- references are bound to the objects to which they are initialized. 


    int foo = 3; 
    int foo2 = 5;
    int& bar = foo; 
    bar = foo2; // now foo = 5, but bar still refers to foo. 

- when implementing operator[], use references e.g. in vectors. 
    
    e.g. vector<int> v[10]; 
         v[5] = 23; 

    operator[] returns a reference in this case.
