destructors are required to cleanup resources 
copy constructors are required to duplicate resources 
whenever you write a destructor, also think about writing a copy constructor as well - because it indicates that there are resources which need to be duplicated. this applies to all resources - not just memory. 
without a copy constructor, resources will not be duplicated, and quite possibly double freed. 

initialization is not assignment 
  a copy constructor is not the same as the assignment operator. 
  consider 
    Foo f = g; 
  is copy constructor. 
    Foo f; 
    f = g; 
  is assignment operator.
