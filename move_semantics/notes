- C++11 has the concept of rvalue references which are denoted by X&&. 
- The older X& references are now called lvalue refernces. 
- The reason for rvalue references is to implement move semantics.

    Instead of copying resources from a temporary to another object, and then calling the destructor in the temporary, its more efficient to swap the pointers between the resources in the temp object and the destination object.
