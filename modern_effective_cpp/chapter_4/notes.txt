why not to use raw pointers: 

    - there is no way to know if its pointing to an object or an array 

    - ownership is ambigous - no one knows who owns the thing its pointing to 

    - its difficult to know what form of delete to use - single-object form "delete" vs "delete[]" array form

    - very easy to get resource leaks - during error conditions or exceptions, its easy to miss out on deleting a pointer. double destruction errors are also possible where destructing more than once leads to undefined behavior. 

    - dangling pointers is possible.
